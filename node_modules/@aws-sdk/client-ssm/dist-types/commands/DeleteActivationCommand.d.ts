 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SSMClient, DeleteActivationCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ssm"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SSMClient, DeleteActivationCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ssm"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SSMClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteActivationRequest

 * };
 * const command = new DeleteActivationCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteActivationCommandInput - {@link DeleteActivationCommandInput}

 * @see {@link DeleteActivationCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteActivationCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SSMClientResolvedConfig | config} for SSMClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServerError} (server fault)
 *  <p>An error occurred on the server side.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidActivation} (client fault)
 *  <p>The activation isn't valid. The activation might have been deleted, or the ActivationId and
 *    the ActivationCode don't match.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidActivationId} (client fault)
 *  <p>The activation ID isn't valid. Verify the you entered the correct ActivationId or
 *    ActivationCode and try again.</p>

 * @throws {@link TooManyUpdates} (client fault)
